**Good friends** welcomes the visitor to a simple yet profound experience, in that sense, i's deliberately designed to focus on the main purpose, which is to learn about friendship. Hopefully to give the reader a good look inside & arround. 

Second purpose is to connect with other potential friends.

*gallery?*

The idéa behind is to learn about 'how to', on a personal level identify friendship and practice socialisation. 

The aim is to create a personal community arround the idéa of friendship. 

*example: "One feels alone, and got no friends. And no idea on where to begin to find friends, let alone, no idea on how to identify what a friend really is."*

**Goal of the website.** 

 - Learn about the concept friendship.
 - Make it easy to feel like you are not alone.
 

## Who is this for ?
 
Anyone who feel like they are missing friends.

"*where are my friends?"* 

*&* for people who just want to hang out and love a good friendship.

*"I just love hanging out with my friends & cannot wait to find more of them"*

# Features

In the top right corner there is a button **contact** which takes you to the contact page.


**Homepage**

Contains a background image of two young boys having a good time.

A text that hints about what ideal friends behaviour can look like. 
The text is contained in a div element that gives a good contrast to the background.

-   Add CAPTCHA to contact form - Allows business to protect the contact form from spam. - Javascript Needed
-   contact form Send button change from _Send_ to _Processing_ and then when complete changes to _Sent_. - Javascript Needed
-   FAQ page, table with FAQs and dropdown buttons to view answers - Gives potential clients easy to find answers to their common questions. - Javascript Needed for dropdown functionality. Simple FAQ page could be implemented now.
-   Friends ' page - Allows new potential friends to discover the website through pictures taken by the community, posted on social media platforms. 
-   Option to choose the language of the website - as the world is getting more connected, and we are still using multiple languages, it would come handy to choose desired language, we should all be able to communicate easily, and become friends with strangers that do not share the same language. Building a comunnity driven platform that together creates guidelines of what friendship looks like. *Note: interesting to see if we all share the same view of an ideal friendship ?*
