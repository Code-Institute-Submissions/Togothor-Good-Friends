                <p>The ideal friend knows how to show weaknes. 
                    Friends shows how much they trust us
                    as they can tell about their shortcommings.</p>
                    
                <p>An ideal friend gives us the gift of vulnerability.</p>
                

                <p>Good friends do not jugde you buy your shortcommings, 
                    because they themselves are aware of their own.</p>
                    
                    <p>A true friend also helps us to build our self-understanding as 
                    most of us probably know just how hard it can be to be aware of ourselves.</p>
                    
                    <p> A good friend also helps us to think, they are curious to know more about the thoughts we have.</p>
                    
                    <p> To answer their questions we need to examine our selves, 
                    this is an excellent gift as it may help us to expand our mind and look further outside of our own perspective.</p>
                    
                    <p>A good friend helps us to like ourselves, they see things of ourselves we're not aware of.</p>
