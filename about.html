                <h1>Good friends of food</h1>
                <p>The ideal friend knows how to show weaknes. 
                    The ideal friend show how much they trust us
                    as they can tell about their shortcommings.
                    
                    an ideal friend gives us the gift of vulnerability.
                    
                    a good friend does not jugde you buy your shortcommings, 
                    because they themselves is aware of their own.
                    
                    A true friend also helps us to build our self-understanding as 
                    problably most of us know just how hard it sometimes can be to see ourself.
                    
                    A good friend also helps us to think, they are curious to know more about the thoughts we have,
                    so to answer their questions we need to examine our selves, 
                    this is an excellent gift as it may help us to expand our mind and look further outside of our perspective.
                    
                    A good friend helps us to like ourselves, they see things of ourselves we're not aware of.
